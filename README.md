### Hi there 👋

This is Yujia 😊

- 🌱 My research interests are system biology and data visualization (Especially on Single-cell omics). 
- 😄 My goal is to integrate these multi-omics data and construct interactions between entities (eg. Network).
- 📚 By using visualize analysis method, the big biological data will tell us a fantastic story.
