### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Yujia Xiang  ðŸ˜Š

My research interests are system biology and data visualization. My goal is to integrate these multi-omics data and construct interactions between entries, using math and computational method to explore the disease-associated molecular mechanism. By using visualize analysis method, the big biological data will tell us a fantastic story. ðŸ“š
